      <h2>Course Overview </h2>
      <p>This course is intended to introduce students to web application development. It aims to
        provide students with an understanding of the core concepts and principles
        underpinning the operation of the web. Students would feel confident in their ability to
        design simple web-based systems from ground up using industry standard tools and
        technologies. This course delivers sound training in the latest web technologies that are
        relevant to build modern and feature-rich web applications. It provides insight into
        state-of-the-art web design practice and introduces emerging topics in web development
        such as package management and version control. Development of web-based systems
        have become an important part of software development and this course is intended to
        equip students with the requisite knowledge and skill. The concepts and principles
        covered in this course would provide a strong foundation for a successful career in web
        application development and software development in general.</p>
      <h2>Course objectives</h2>
      <p>This course is designed to achieve the following objectives
        <br><ul>
          <li> Equip students with the knowledge of how the web works, focusing primarily on
            concepts and core principles.

            administer impromptu quizzes prior to tutorials.
            </li>
          <li> Self-directed study and extensive research are essential components for
            proficiency in web application development. A minimum of 12 additional
            hours per week for practice is strongly advised.</li>
          <li> Proactive learning is encouraged; students are expected to prepare ahead
            of class. This preparatory work will be evaluated through periodic quizzes
            administered before each session.
